                Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. 
                While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it
                and lay it out.
                For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, 
                split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
            </p>
        </section>

            <header class="section-header"><h2>Prerequisites</h2></header>
            <p>
            You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS.
            Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the
            same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
            and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't learn CSS without knowing HTML.
            Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web passively
            (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content).
            You should have a basic work environment set up, and understand how to create and manage files.
            To Summarize, the prerequisites for this documentation include the following;
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HTML</li>
                <li>Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web passively</li>
                <li>A basic work environment set up, and an understanding of how to create and manage files.</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="What_is_CSS" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>What is CSS</h2></header>

            <p>
                Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either.
                CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
                For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">p</span> 
                    {
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the four lines of CSS (above) into a new file.
                Save the file as style.css in a directory named styles.To make the code work, we still need
                 to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the
                appearance of the HTML
            </p>

            <p>
                Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, 
                presenting your markup using whatever design you like.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="CSS_Syntax" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>CSS Syntax</h2></header>

            <p>
                CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be
                applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example
                 "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."
                The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">h1</span> 
                    {
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >red</span>;
                    <span class="property">font-size</span>: <span class="value" >5em</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>   
                The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style.
                In this case we are styling level one headings.
                We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations,
                which take the form of property and value pairs.
                Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like
                to give the property. Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. 
                CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified.
                In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. 
                We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.
            </p>
            
        </section>

        <section id="Selectors" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>Selectors</h2></header>
            <p>
                A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that
                tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside 
                the rule applied to them.
                The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined
                into a selector list so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors.
                For example, if I have the same CSS for an h1 and also a class of .special,
                I could write this as two separate rules.

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">h1</span> 
                    {
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    }
                
                    <span class="selector">.special</span> 
                    {
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma between them.

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">h1, .special</span> 
                    {
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            White space is valid before or after the comma. You may also find the selectors more readable
            if each is on a new line.

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">h1,
                    .special</span> 
                    {
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Properties_and_Values" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>Properties and Values</h2></header>

            <p>
                At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Properties: </strong>These are human-readable identifiers
                        that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify.
                        For example, font-size, width, background-color.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Values: </strong> Each property is assigned a value.
                        This value indicates how to style the property.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The example below highlights a single property and value.
                The property name is color and the value is blue
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">h1</span> 
                    {
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a CSS declaration.
                CSS declarations are found within CSS Declaration Blocks.
                In the example below, highlighting identifies the CSS declaration block.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    <span class="property">background-color </span>: <span class="value" >yellow</span>;
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS rulesets (or CSS rules).
                The example below contains two rules: one for the h1 selector and one for the p selector.
                The colored highlighting identifies the h1 rule.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">h1</span> 
                    {
                       <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                       <span class="property">background-color </span>: <span class="value" >yellow</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Setting CSS properties to specific values is the primary way of defining layout and styling for
                a document.
                The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page.
                CSS properties and values are case-insensitive. The property and value in a property-value pair
                are separated by a colon (:).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Cascading_and_Inheritance" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>Cascading and Inheritance</h2></header>

            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and that first word cascading is incredibly important
                to understand — the way that the cascade behaves is key to understanding CSS.
                At some point, you will be working on a project and you will find that the CSS you thought
                should be applied to an element is not working.
                Usually, the problem is that you have created two rules which could potentially apply to the
                same element.
                The cascade, and the closely-related concept of specificity,
                are mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict.
                Which rule is styling your element may not be the one you expect, so you need to understand
                how these mechanisms work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also significant here is the concept of inheritance, which means that some CSS properties by
                default inherit values
                set on the current element's parent element, and some don't.
                This can also cause some behavior that you might not expect.
                Let's start by taking a quick look at the key things we are dealing with,
                then we'll look at each in turn and see how they interact with each other and your CSS.
                This can seem like a set of tricky concepts to understand.
                As you get more practice writing CSS, the way it works will become more obvious to you.
            </p>

            <h3>The Cascade</h3>
            <p>
                Stylesheets cascade — at a very simple level, this means that the order of CSS rules matters;
                when two rules apply that have equal specificity, the one that comes last in the CSS is the
                one that will be used.
                In the below example, we have two rules that could apply to the h1 element.
                The h1 ends up being colored blue. This is because both the rules have an identical element selector,
                and therefore, carry the same specificity, but the last one in the source order wins.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">h1</span> 
                    {
                       <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >red</span>;
                    }
                    <span class="selector">h1</span> 
                    {
                       <span class="property">color </span>: <span class="value" >blue</span>;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>
                Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context — some CSS property values set on
                parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't. For example, if you
                set a color and font-family on an element, every element inside it will also be styled with 
                that color and font, unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some properties do not inherit — for example, if you set a width of 50% on an element,
                all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their parent's width.
                If this was the case, CSS would be very frustrating to use!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="CSS_Specificity" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>CSS Specificity</h2></header>

            <p>
                Specificity is how the browser decides which rule applies if multiple rules have different selectors,
                but could still apply to the same element. It is basically a measure of how specific a selector's
                selection will be:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An element selector is less specific — it will select all elements of that type that appear on a
                     page — so will get a lower score.
                </li>
                <li>A class selector is more specific — it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific
                    class attribute value — so will get a higher score
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Example time! Below, we again have two rules that could apply to the h1.
                The h1 ends up being colored red — the class selector main-heading gives its rule a higher
                specificity, and so it will be applied even though the rule with the h1 element selector
                appears further down in the source order.

            <p>
                Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being 
                able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will 
                take a proper look at the CSS Box Model so that you can build more complex layout tasks with
                an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes — block boxes and inline boxes.
                These characteristics refer to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation
                to other boxes on the page.
                Boxes also have an inner display type and an outer display type.
                If a box has an outer display type of block, it will behave in the following ways:

            <ul>
                <li>The box will break onto a new line.</li>
                <li>box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container.
                    In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
                </li>
                <li>The width and height properties are respected.</li>
                <li>Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some HTML elements, such as h1 and p, use block as their outer display type by default.</p>
            
            <p>If a box has an outer display type of inline, then:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The box will not break onto a new line.</li>
                <li>Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause 
                    other inline boxes to move away from the box.</li>
                <li>The width and height properties will not apply.</li>
                <li>Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other
                 inline boxes to move away from the box.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the CSS box model?</h3>
            <p>          
                The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes.
                Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model. 
                The model defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content
                — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. To add some additional complexity,
                there is a standard and an alternate box model.
            </p>
            <h3>Parts of a box</h3>
            
            <p>Making up a block box in CSS we have the:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content box:</strong> The area where your content is displayed,
                     which can be sized using properties like width and height.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Padding box:</strong> The padding sits around the content as white space;
                     its size can be controlled using padding and related properties.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Border box:</strong> The border box wraps the content and any padding.
                     Its size and style can be controlled using border and related properties.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Margin box:</strong> The margin is the outermost layer,
                     wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements.
                    Its size can be controlled using margin and related properties.
                </li>
            </ul>
